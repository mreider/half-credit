campsite. Sneakers in common. Music in common. A NASTY look from a tent mate. Responsible male African American Luis teacher light skinned, comes down - awkward - does not like the woods. Tells everyone it's time to go to sleep.

Night around a fire. Christina and Magda (ugly) visiting the campsite. Tent mate Rich. talking to them, and they are fawning over him and another guy. Both Noah and Kelvin sitting there watching, not part of it, girls giving nasty looks to both of them.  Less attractive girl, "who's that sorta cute." He needs a shower." third girl. "That's Noah. He was here last year. Identity crisis, but cute. "we're in the woods, we all need a shower." Him especially. Rather hook up with the other one." "You're fucking joking right?" "Laughs. What do you think?

"You get pussy at this school? "Got close last year. Something tells me it's about to get more challenging." - "For us both."

Boston. He's over. Small ghetto blaster. play. Gold chains. My mom thinks I look like a pimp. You don't know how good you have it. Actually I don't. Hear that? Never home. "Mom, can I borrow 20 bucks?" Nothing. Call her. I don't even know where she is "using the dark room" she says. For black people? No, it's for photographers.

Ok, so how you get all this stuff. Your pa? Who? No, so I get it all myself. How, you got a job. Sort of. Let me show you. Computer numbers with MCI numbers. trade this for that. My brother and sister send me money for 'em at school. But the real profit is in the trading. Login to BBS. This for that. How they get 'em they work at the mall or something, and they take an extra carbon copy real quick, and send it to me.

Ok, so then what? See there are two kinds of hacking. And the kind I'm good at is social hacking. Here I'll show you. First we call the merchant verification and make sure the card is still good. Doesn't actually charge it, just makes sure there is room on it." Now Which one you want? Oh shit really? I want that one. (Rope chain). Ah, the rope chain. A classic choice. Calls Service Merchandise. "Now what, where we pick it up?" I'll show you that part later.

 At school. Putting books into lockers. "Yo, come here, I got a present for you." "Oh shit, really?" Shows him the rope chain. Oh shit. That's so fresh. Girls walk by, what now Noah, selling dope out of your high school locker? As they walk away, "Why he always hanging around the black kids?" "I don't know, you really don't think he's cute? (lesser ugly) "Oh my God, will you stop? Sees Rich, breaks off, touches one of their chests." Lesser locks eyes with Noah.

Older teacher Madam. Baptist walks by and eyes the gold chain, taking mental notes, then passes by Rich and Christina. Rich pushes her away and adjusts himself to look good. She smiles at Rich and looks down her nose obnoxiosly. Is that the new scholarship student (still with bunched up nose) - Magda upbeat, "his name is Kelvin."

Time passing with hip hop music into winter and spring. Shows fake ID with his picture on it. Shows Mailboxes etc. Shows call to Mailboxes etc. owner. New rope chains. New ghetto blaster. Christina sees it. Baptiste sees it. She is seen talking to Magda.

Spring...

Noah at locker. Other kids former friend, Matt, listening to Led Zeppelin. Invites him to check is out. Kashmir. Pretty good. Kelvin walks by and frowns, and Noah sort of shrugs, these are his people too. He looks like he fits in. Kelvin looks bigger. Like he's been lifting weights. "That dude is getting buff." "Yeah, he spends all his time recently in the weight room, even during break and lunch." "You guys seemed close? What happeneed? Conflict of interest."

Mom comes in to talk one on one with both Madam Baptiste and Luis. Explains that it isn't him, that it's not her place to make trouble, but the problem is coming from elsewhere. Not naming names. She leaves. Luis, pretty obvious where elsewhere is, I ain't getting involved with that. Baptiste, distinguished family, could backfire on us. Luis - more on me than you I'd think. Baptiste, perhaps. Luis "why you stick your nose in there anyhow, you hear some rumors from these hormonal boys who fantasize about you, and you take it upon yourself." Kids come to me for help. Teen pregnancies, drugs, abusive parents. I'm here for them. And what exactly do you get out of it?" He leaves, and there is Rich waiting. "You seem to spend a lot of time together." "Problems at home" says Rich. "Have a nice chat you two."

With Magda. What are you doing on Saturday, she asks. Matt's parents are out of town. You want to come by? That sounds awesome. Can I bring a friend? "not her" - She's ok. Outside Madam Baptiste, calls him inside. Sits and talks for a while. "How are things at home?" It has come to my attention. Somehow blames it or places blame on Kelvin. He sort of goes along with it without revealing anything. Baptiste calls his mom, she sits with him. He's in big trouble. His mother hits him at home. He reveals all to his mom. Are you kidding me?
